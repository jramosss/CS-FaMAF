# Secret-Voldemort
This repository was created for the development for the front-end part of the game `Secret Voldemort`

# Install dependencies
Once downloaded the folder, get to the `secret-voldemort/src`  folder and then in an Ubuntu/Linux run the command `npm install dependencies`.

# Usage
Get to the `secret-voldemort/src` folder and then in an Ubuntu/Linux terminal run the command `npm start`. Once the server has started we need to clone the next repository `https://github.com/ibaldoncini/Back-Pytherin` and follow the instructions in the `README.md` of that repository to get the game working.
